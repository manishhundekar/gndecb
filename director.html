    <p class="card-text"><p>Of the four sojourns of Guru Nanak Devji, the second one covered Deccan and SriLanka, during which he passed through Bidar, where, in response to the prayers of local inhabitants, he touched the rock with his right toe and a perenial fresh water spring continues to flow to this day. Thus it begot the name SRI NANAK JHIRA SAHEB. </p><br>
            <p>A prabandhak committee was formed in 1950 to renovate and develop Gurdwara under the Presidenship of Pant Bhushan Sant Sardar Bhishan Singhji.  Unfortunately in the year 1966, Santji expired and the mantle fell on the shoulders of his son  Sardar Joga Singhji who continued to provide stewardship to the Prabandhak Committee to the welfare and up-liftment of Human Society. </p><br>
            <p>As developing activities were growing fast, a public, Religious, Educational and Charitable trust by the name Sri Nanak Jhira Saheb Foundation was established in March 1987 by the Prabandhak Committee Gurudwara Sri Nanak Jhira Saheb, Bidar.</p><br><p>Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Bidar, a premier center of Technical Education, was established in August, 1980 by the Prabandhak Committee, Gurudwara Sri Nanak Jhira Saheb, Bidar as per the Govt. of Karnataka Order No.ED 150 TEC 79, dated 8th August, 1980.</p><br>
            <p>At present College is being managed by Sri Nanak Jhira Saheb Foundation (Trust). Initially, the College was affiliated to Gulbarga University, Gulbarga. However, subsequently a separate Technical University Viz. Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belagavi, has been established during the academic year 1998-99, since then this College has been affiliated to the said University. </p><br>
            <p>This College is approved by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi and was Accredited twice by National Board of Accreditation (N.B.A.), New Delhi during the year 2005 and 2009. GNDEC started in the year 1980 with an annual intake of 120 in three traditional branches. Currently 2500 students all over from country benefit from a rare level of education imparted through professionals.</p><br>
            <p>The meticulous planning and foresight of the management has ensured that every facility is provided to the students. Sophisticated and modern equipment are added to facilitate Research and Development work. The campus has optical Fiber Network and is wi-fi enabled. The excellent facilities and infrastructure are in the form of Administrative Building, Auditorium, Central Library, Separate Digital Library. Laboratories are fully developed to meet the requirements of different discipilines. The consistent high quality performance of its alumni has given the college an edge over other institutions thereby earning a reputation for honesty, integrity and innovative education</p><br>
