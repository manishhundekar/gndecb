              <p>Mechanical Engineering branch started in the year 1980 is actively involved in number of research projects sponsored by AICTE, New Delhi and KSCST, Bangalore. Experienced faculties guide students through an optimally balanced medium of instruction supplemented by a wide range of facilities. </p>
              <p>We have a strong undergraduate program in mechanical engineering. At the postgraduate level, we offer M.Tech in Computer Integrated Manufacturing. The sanctioned intake in UG and M.Tech programs are 120 and 18 respectively. The department has Research and development centre recognized by VTU Belagavi as weel as AICTE New Delhi. The primary focus of our program is to impart technical know-how to students in cutting edge technology and enhance their problem solving skills through innovative methods of teaching. Department offers large number of optional courses to enhance the knowledge of student in interdisciplinary areas, our department has a distinguished record in both teaching and research. Undergraduate students are encouraged to undertake various research projects. Active participation of students in project work results into sponsorship of projects by KSCST, Bengaluru. Our student project got best project of the year award for the year 2017-2018 by KSCST, Bengaluru. Faculty members have excellent academic credentials and actively involved in research work. Faculty members published several papers in national and international journals. Department has changed the teaching pattern from theory based teaching to hands on experience based teaching, which will help the students in becoming industry ready product and hence will become employable. The department conduct number of student centric program through ISTE chapters and MESA(Mechanical Engineering Students Association) every year. This website provides an overview of the academic programs, research activities of our departments, research facilities, profiles of faculty members and details of student activities. We hope that whether you are a prospective undergraduate or graduate student, or working in industry, or another university, or a visitor, you will find this website to be informative.<br>

             <p> While imparting knowledge from the prescribed curriculum, we feel importance should also be given to practical knowledge also. Continuous improvement is the need of the time, so we are striving hard to get the latest knowledge and deliver it to our students.<br>
              “Coming together is beginning, staying together is progress and working together is success”. We firmly believe in the statements “None of us is stronger than all of us”, so let us start working together to reach our goals. We are sure that with the blessings of almighty God, our students will achieve their goals and serve society, nation and humanity at large.</p>

                        <h4>R&D Cell Overview</h4>
                        <p>Mechanical Engineering Department of G.N.D.E.C.B established in 1980 with an intake of 60 in course and presently it is now 120. The department started P.G. course in Computer Integrated Manufacuturing (CIM) from the academic year 2010-11 and simeltaneously got permission for establishing R & D center from the V.T.U. Belgaum and recognosed by AICTE, New Delhi. Presently 13 research scholars are working for Ph.D. as well as M.Sc.(Engg) by research. One candidate already received Ph.D. degree and other received M.Sc.(Engg) by research from our R & D center. </p>
                        <p>We have established Composite Material Testing Laboratory where Researchers can Fabricate Composite Materials using handlayup technique and cure it in hot-air oven. The fabricated specimens can be subjected to testing of mechanical properties like Tensile, Flexural strength and Inter-Laminar Strength in Computerized universal testing machine of 10KN Capacity.</p>
                        <p>The lab will also help other research scholars who are working in composite material area through other research center of the country.</p>
                        <p>We also provide technical assistance for the development of UG/PG projects for the academics and Industries. </p>
