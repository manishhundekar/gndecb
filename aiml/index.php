           <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) Course is rapidly growing fields in computer science that are revolutionizing the way we interact with technology. AI involves creating intelligent systems that can perform tasks that typically require human-like intelligence, such as speech recognition, image recognition, and decision making. ML, on the other hand, is a subset of AI that involves developing algorithms and models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that learning.
We have started our exciting journey in the year of 2021, with sanctioned student strength of 60. AIML Departmental 50% of the faculties are Either Completed the Ph.d    or Pursuing and Guiding    7 research Scholars in their relevant field of Expertise. Department is having Unique Students Association “pAIthon” which is actively organizing Technical, Co- curricular, Cultural Activities for Overall Development of the Students. The primary focus of the course is to impart technical know-how to students, promote their problem-solving skills and innovation of new technologies introducing new developments. We have state of the art laboratories, Digitally Equipped classrooms, dedicated well qualified and trained faculty in emerging areas. 
An AI & ML course can be beneficial for professionals in various industries, such as healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing, who want to incorporate AI & ML into their work. It can also be beneficial for students interested in pursuing a career in AI &ML or related fields, such as data science, robotics, and computer vision etc….
